The frontend of the online shopping cart is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers while they shop for their desired products. The cart interface is built using a combination of HTML and CSS to create an engaging and responsive design.

Key Components:

Product Listing:
The product listing section displays various products available for purchase. Each product is represented as a card, showcasing an image, title, price, and possibly a brief description. CSS is used to style these cards with consistent spacing, fonts, and colors.

Add to Cart Button:
Each product card includes an "Add to Cart" button that customers can click to add the selected item to their shopping cart. When clicked, the button triggers a JavaScript function to update the cart's content.

Shopping Cart Icon:
A shopping cart icon is usually displayed at the top of the page, indicating the number of items currently in the cart. This icon provides a quick way for users to access their cart's content.

Cart Preview:
When users hover over the shopping cart icon, a small preview of the cart's content appears, showing a summary of the added items. This can include the product names, quantities, and total price.

Cart Page:
Clicking on the shopping cart icon or a dedicated "View Cart" button takes users to the cart page. This page displays a detailed list of the items in the cart, including images, names, quantities, individual prices, and subtotal for each item.
